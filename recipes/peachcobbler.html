    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>You don't need a lot of ingredients to make an impressive, crowd-pleasing dessert. Take this quick and easy peach cobbler, for instance: It comes together in under an hour with just five ingredients you probably already have on hand.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Â½ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) cans sliced peaches in heavy syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix self-rising flour, sugar, and milk together in a bowl until well combined and no lumps remain.</li>
        <li>Pour melted butter into a 2-quart baking dish (or a 9- or 10-inch cast iron skillet). Pour flour-milk mixture over top.</li>
        <li>Carefully pour peaches and syrup into the skillet. Use a spatula to spread peaches evenly around the pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust turns golden brown, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let cool for about 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
